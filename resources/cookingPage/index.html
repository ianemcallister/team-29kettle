        There is an art to cooking.  We’ll cover the specifics of that art in as much detail as possible, but part of becoming a great nut cook is practice over time.  This section should be used as a resource that you come back to repeatedly over your time with 29 Kettle because part of being great at something is the unending drive to improve.  To make the best nuts in the world we are always focused on how to achieve the hightest level of quality.

            <strong>Starting Initial Batch</strong>
        </div>
        <div class="col-10">
            To start the initial batch:
            <ol>
                <li>Assuming that the kettle was warming up with water, turn the paddle off by pressing the green button.</li>
                <li>Rotate the paddle arm up 90 degrees to its resting position.</li>
                <li>Remove the kettle from the heating element by grabbing both handles, twisting the kettle slightly counter-clockwise [disengaging the stopper] while pulling the kettle up and off of the heating element.</li>
                <li>There should still be water in the kettle, at this time empty the water into the catch bucket of your hand wash station and return the kettle to the left front corner of the roaster.  Place it there while you pour the contents of the batch into the kettle.</li>
                <li>Open the staged ziploc(s) and pour the nuts and sugar contents into the kettle.</li>
                <li>If the ziploc is not sticky or broken in any way, recycle the ziploc(s) into the ziplocs returning container. If the bag is sticky or broken in any way discard it completely in the waste bag.</li>
                <li>Pour the contents of the liquid measuring cup into the kettle.</li>
                <li>Pickup the kettle with both handles, lower the kettle over the heating element, making sure that the notch on the kettle points to the front, right corner of the roaster.  Once the kettle is sitting on the heating element, twist the kettle clockwise until the notch engages and the kettle won’t turn anymore.</li>
                <li>Press the green button on the roaster to start the paddle turning again.  Make sure that the green button remains depressed after you push it.  Sometimes (usually when the kettle is too hot) the green button won’t stay depressed, see trouble shooting for more information on these situations).</li>
                <li>Pull the paddle arm down 90 degrees again until it is sitting on the mixing position.  If the paddle is properly spinning as you pull the arm down it should sweep any nuts out of the way as it comes down.  Our goal is to keep the nuts as whole as possible, trying not to break them whenever possible.</li>
                <li>For sweet & salty batches place the sweet & salty spritz bottle on the back-left corner of the roaster to “flag” the batch.  For drunk batches place the drunk spritz bottle on the back-left corner of the roaster.</li>

            <strong>Changing Batches</strong>
        </div>
        <div class="col-10">
            Changing batches is a task that will be performed many times through a cooking shift.  Executing this process successfully requires precision, speed, and skill:
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the next batch as described in the “Preparing to cook a batch” section.</li>
                <li>Once the batch is “ready” (as described by Identifying the “Done” point) spritz the current batch, 2 seconds for a half batch, 3 seconds for a full batch.  Your goal is to touch every nut with a bit of liquid.  The liquid helps the sugar to stop cooking as quickly as possible, a proper spritz helps produce the highest quality nuts.  A proper spritz will also create a cloud that will attract/intrigue customers.</li>
                <li>After spritzing, return the spritz bottle to the cooking surface and count the paddle as it passes the front of the roaster.</li>
                <li>While counting put the oven mit on your non-dominant hand and pick up a wooden spatula in your dominant hand</li>
                <li>After five rotations of the paddle, turn the paddle off by pressing the green button with your dominant hand.  Make sure to stop the paddle when it is at the front of the roaster.  Stopping the paddle at the back of the roaster increases the chances that the kettle will get stuck on the paddle while removing it, this can cause spills or injuries.</li>
                <li>Moving quickly, scrape some of the sugar off the rod holding the paddle with the wooden spatula in your dominant hand, if you don’t it might melt after you remove the kettle and drip on to the heating element, this will produce an unpleasant smell and some smoke.  Then rotate the paddle arm up 90 degrees to its resting position with your non-dominant hand.</li>
                <li>Remove the kettle from the heating element by grabbing both handles.  Your oven mitt hand (non-dominant) should do most of the work, using your dominant hand (perhaps only a finger) to steady the kettle as you move it.  Twist the kettle slightly counter-clockwise [disengaging the stopper] while pulling the kettle up and off of the heating element.</li>
                <li>Quickly move the kettle over the stack of foil pans.  Pouring as much as possible with your non-dominant hand use the wooden spatula in your dominant hand to scrape as much nuts and sugar out of the kettle as possible into the top foil pan.  This process takes particular precision and practice as the sugar cools quickly and once it cools it is very difficult to get off.   Your primary goal is to leave no nuts in the kettle.  Your secondary goal is to leave as little sugar in the kettle as possible.  While the sugar is still hot is a good opportunity to scrape the rim of the kettle that the nuts are poured over, keeping your tools as clean as possible.</li>
                <li>Place the kettle on the front-left corner of the roaster.  Return the wooden spatula and oven mitt to their neutral positions.</li>
                <li>Shake the nuts that you just poured into the foil pans so they flatten out as much as possible.</li>
                <li>Open the staged ziploc(s) you’ve placed in preparation and pour the nuts and sugar contents into the kettle.</li>
                <li>If the ziploc is not sticky or broken in any way, recycle the ziploc(s) into the ziplocs returning container. If the bag is sticky or broken in any way discard it completely in the waste bag.</li>
                <li>Pour the contents of the liquid measuring cup into the kettle.</li>
                <li>Pickup the kettle with both handles, lower the kettle over the heating element, making sure that the notch on the kettle points to the front, right corner of the roaster.  Once the kettle is sitting on the heating element, twist the kettle clockwise until the notch engages and the kettle won’t turn anymore.</li>
                <li>Press the green button on the roaster to start the paddle turning again.</li>
                <li>Pull the paddle arm down 90 degrees again until it is sitting on the mixing position.  If the paddle is properly spinning as you pull the arm down it should sweep any nuts out of the way as it comes down.  Our goal is to keep the nuts as whole as possible, trying not to break them whenever possible.</li>
                <li>For sweet & salty batches place the sweet & salty spritz bottle on the back-left corner of the roaster to “flag” the batch.  For drunk batches place the drunk spritz bottle on the back-left corner of the roaster.</li>
                <li>Turning your attention back to the freshly cooked nuts, flip the contents in the trays several times.</li>
                <li>Lightly salt all the nuts.</li>
                <li>Turn them over several more times.</li>
                <li>Lightly salt a second time.</li>

            <strong>Transferring cooled nuts to sampling/serving bins</strong>
        </div>
        <div class="col-10">
            <p>We want to sample warm nuts, but we also don’t want to burn customers.  We also don’t want nuts to harden into a brick in the sampling/serving bins.  When to pour the nuts into the sampling/serving bins is a bit of a subjective process too.  As a general rule of thumb nuts should be transferred before the next batch comes off the kettle, but if they’re not sticking together then they can be transferred to the sampling/serving bins shortly after being salted too.  This will take a little practice.  Each flavor is a little different.  Pecans tend to be stickier than the other nuts and drunk recipes tend to be stickier than sweet & salty recipes.  Almonds, peanuts, cashews, and hazelnuts can generally be poured off shortly after salting, pecans tend to take more time to cool before they are ready to be poured.</p>
            <p>When you transfer the nuts from the foil pans pour along the short side of the foil pans into the long side of the sampling/serving bins.  We often try to shift the nuts already in the sampling/serving bins to one side to encourage the new batch and the old batch to mix together.  We don’t totally want to practice first-in-first-out with the nuts that we cook, but it can be difficult not to.</p>

            <strong>Batches Timing</strong>
        </div>
        <div class="col-10">
            <p>Generally speaking full batches take about 15 minutes and half batches take about 10 minutes.  That being said, we don’t time our batches.  Cooking times can vary based on a number of factors, including but not limited to, outside temperature, kettle temperature, humidity, wind, power source, etc.  If you’d like to time your batches as a reference point for yourself that is fine, though you should rely on your ability to spot the “done point” rather than the time a batch has been cooking.</p>

            <strong>Nut roasting stages</strong>
        </div>
        <div class="col-10">
            <p>There are three distinct stages to observe when we’re cooking, the initial wet stage, the dry stage, and the second wet (oily) stage.  One of the first skills of cooking great nuts is the ability to consistently identify these stages.</p>
            <p><strong><u>The initial wet stage</u></strong><br>This initial stage occurs when we pour the liquid (sweet & salty mix or drunk mix) into the kettle with the sugar and nuts. The liquid quickly mixes with the sugar and nuts and can be observed as a liquid mixture on the bottom of the kettle.</p>
            <p><strong><u>The dry stage</u></strong><br>The dry stage is a distinct stage at which the nuts look chalky.  During this stage a portion of the liquid has evaporated and a portion of the liquid has been absorbed by the nuts and sugar.  It is a good practice to note when the dry stage has been reached, as it will help you to identify when you’re entering the third stage, or the second wet (oily) stage.</p>
            <p><strong><u>The second wet (oily) stage</u></strong><br>This third stage is interesting because the liquid we’re observing in this stage is the oil being released from the nuts themselves.  Our roaster operates at just the right temperature to release this oil from the nuts but not burn the sugar too quickly.  You’ll first notice the nuts that touch the kettle starting to become oily.  As the nuts are turned over more and more nuts will start to be covered in an oily liquid. Knowing when the nuts are done will rely on your ability to observe the progress of this oily stage.</p>

            <strong>Identifying the “Done” point</strong>
        </div>
        <div class="col-10">
            <p>We consider nuts “Done” when 75% of the nuts are 75% glossy.  Obviously this is subjective and spotting this point requires strong observation skills and practice.  We want to help you become an expert at spotting this point.</p>
            <p>Spotting this 75/75 glossy point is best done by observing the nuts in the center of the roaster, closest to the paddle as these will be changing last (furthest from the walls of the kettle and the heat source).  When you’re looking for glossy you’re looking for light reflecting off of the nuts.  Chalky nuts don’t reflect light the same way that glossy nuts do.  Glossy nuts will reflect points of white on the tips of the nuts, this is ultimately what you’re looking for.</p>
            <p>Additionally, all of the nuts will display this point differently.  Cashews for example will turn a much darker color than they started at, but don’t let the color deceive you, you’re still looking for the 75/75 glossy point.</p>

            <p>We do not clean our kettles between batches.  If someone is allergic to any of the nuts we sell there is a chance that there may be cross-contamination because we cook all of the nuts in the same kettle.  Usually customers are self selecting with trying/buying our nuts and they stay away if there is a chance they might be allergic, but occasionally we find it necessary to communicate that we cook all of the nuts in the same kettle.</p>

            <p>The kettle and prep tables should be wiped down with a wet paper towel or bar towel about once per hour. This keeps sugar, liquids and dirt from building up on the tables.</p>
            <p>At the end of each market, the kettle and prep tables should be thoroughly cleaned with a wet paper towel or bar towel.</p>
            <p>Nut tables must also be cleaned with a wet paper towel at the end of an event after the table covering is removed.</p>
            <p>Check the size example table each hour to make sure it is clean and that customers haven't left or spilled anything on it.</p>

        <div class="col-10">
            <p>All surfaces of the kettle should be wiped down thoroughly with a wet paper towel or bar towel at least once every two hours. This includes the underside of the stirring arm motor area and the "hinge" that opens up when you raise and lower the stirring arm motor.</p>
            <p>One half an hour before you will be leaving (or later if you're busy and still need to roast), the kettle must undergo a thorough cleaning.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Fill the kettle with clean water as high as is possible</li>
                <li>Turn on the stirring arm</li>
                <li>Bring to a boil </li>
                <li>Dump the hot water into the waste bucket slowly, allowing the hot water to run over the rim of the kettle, taking any stuck and hardened particles with it.</li>
                <li>Turn off the kettle and thoroughly wipe down all kettle surfaces with a very wet paper towel or bar towel. Use as many paper towels as needed to give it a good and thorough cleaning.</li>
